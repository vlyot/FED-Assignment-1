                    Sonder is the work of producers Atu and Dpat with lead vocals by Baltimore-based singer Brent Faiyaz,
                    and the collaborative entity makes smooth and somewhat futuristic R&B designed for late nights and bleary mornings. 
                    They started out making more raw and fragmented songs but softened their approach as their music reached a wider audience, 
                    with each the tracks from 2017's retro-fitted Into and 2022 release Too Late To Die Young individually streaming in the multimillions.

                    Sonder was formed in 2016 and started their run in a flurry of productivity. In the fall of 2016,
                     the group released singles "Victoria," "Undone," and "Sheath" in quick succession, all three songs notable in their seductive, 
                     low-lit production and extended running times -- none were under ten minutes long. Gaining momentum and buzz from this initial blast of 
                     particularly uniform tracks, Sonder followed up in the early months of 2017 with the seven-song EP Into, dialing back the track times and switching 
                     styles somewhat from the smokescreen haze of their early output, and instead opting for a more direct sound that nodded to the production of '90s R&B 
                     innovators like Timbaland and Ginuwine. 
                     <br>
                     During this time, Faiyaz was also active releasing songs solo under the A.M. Paradox moniker.
                      Early 2018 saw the trio issue the smoky single "One Night Only," and the next year the group released the warped and atmospheric new song "What You Heard."
                       As the years went on, all of the group's tracks were eventually streamed millions of times. In 2021, Sonder released the song "Nobody but You,"

                       featuring a hook with vocals from England's Jorja Smith. The next installation of new music from Sonder arrived in October of 2022 with five-song 
                       EP Too Late to Die Young.
