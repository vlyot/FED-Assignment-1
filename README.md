Assignment 1 done by Ng Kai Chong for FED Module
# Project Name: SONDER

Sonder is one of, if not my favourite bands of all-time. However, I realised that they did not have a good website that allowed them to gain exposure or allowed fans to interact/learn more about the band. I wanted to create a platform that allowed old and new fans to do so. Since the band is semi active both onlien and in terms of making music, my website would help fans understand more about the band.

 
## Design Process
 
User Profile:

Primary Audience: Fans of the musical collective Sonder, as well as potential new listeners interested in discovering the band's discography and background.

Goals:

1. Provide a well-designed and visually pleasing website for users to explore Sonder's music and learn more about the band.
2. Facilitate easy and accessible streaming of Sonder's discography for both existing fans and new audiences.
3. Allow more exposure so that future companies may be interested in hiring SONDER for a gig

User Stories:

As a fan, I want an introduction to Sonder's sound and story, so I can connect with the band.
As a listener, I want to explore the members of the group Brent Faiyaz, Atu, and Dpat, so I can see the band's background and influences.
As a music enthusiast, I want to use Sonder's discography to discover and enjoy their entire catalog.
As a user, I want to be able to stream Sonder's music through the website so i can view all the albums and listen along to them.
As a fan, I want to stay informed about Sonder's digital presence including updates and announcements, so I can keep up to date with the band.

## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Newsletter form :
    1. Go to the "Activity" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

On smaller aspect ratios, the text will remain the same size, and the viewport length will increase.
